# GFM UI Recolor

This project patches the UI of 

	Divergences of Darkness Rework 
		https://github.com/TheDeNuke/Divergences-of-Darkness-Rework-Public
		https://www.moddb.com/mods/divergences-of-darkness-rework-dodr

	Jupiterson's Duhamel GUI 
		https://github.com/Jupiterson/Duhamel-GUI

and allows you to use them while playing GFM. 
Why only GFM? Because it's the only mod I play and i have no desire to test or add compatibility to any other mods. I changed almost 100 files combined, so no, this isn't a straight re-upload. 

Showcasing every change here is neither productive nor overseeable, so in conclusion: more consistent UI and some of my own changes such as the minimap or the topbar country title.

## Suggestions/Criticism
If you do have any, send them to my discord Delta#6996 or put me on blast in the Issues.

### Installation
You know how this works, if not DM or ping me on Discord Delta#6996, I'm to lazy to write this part.

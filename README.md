# GFM UI Recolor

This project patches the UI of 

   -Jupiterson's Duhamel GUI (https://github.com/Jupiterson/Duhamel-GUI  /  https://www.moddb.com/mods/duhamel-gui) 
   
   -Divergences of Darkness Rework (https://github.com/TheDeNuke/Divergences-of-Darkness-Rework-Public  /  https://www.moddb.com/mods/divergences-of-darkness-rework-dodr)
  
and allows you to use them while playing GFM. 
Why only GFM? Because it's the only mod I play and i have no desire to test or add compatibility to any other mods.

TODO:
-add screens to readme
-install instructions
-suggestions (other colors/or UI redesigns)
